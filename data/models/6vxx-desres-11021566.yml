pdbids:
  - 6vxx
proteins:
  - spike

  - SARS-CoV-2
description: >
  Solvated structure of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in closed state.  The C- and N-peptide termini are 
  capped with amide and acetyl groups respectively. The system was solvated, neutralized and salted with NaCl, with 
  a final concentration of 0.15 M.
