title: DESRES-ANTON-10895671 30 µs of accelerated weighted ensemble MD simulation of a chimeric RBD in complex with ACE2
description: >
    SARS-CoV-2 attachment to host cells is mediated by a protein-protein interaction between the 
    receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and the human ACE2 receptor. We performed 
    a 30 µs of  preliminary accelerated weighted ensemble (AWE) MD simulations of a chimeric RBD in 
    complex with ACE2 (PDB entry 6VW1). In the simulation the complex was stable, and no dissociation 
    events were observed. The AWE facilitated sampling of hundreds of binding and thousands of unbinding 
    events over an aggregate 30 µs of AWE simulation. We provide all ~415,000 conformations sampled 
    during the AWE simulations, and the corresponding graph adjacency matrix with 
    weights. From analysis of the AWE simulation data, we also provide four representative trajectories 
    containing binding events and a free energy landscape estimated using a history-augmented Markov 
    state model. The complex model was solvated in a ~140 Å box of 200 mM NaCl and water, and parameterized 
    with the DES-Amber protein and ion force field, the TIP4P-D water model, and an in-house force field 
    derived from GAFF. Simulations were performed under the NPT ensemble at 300 K. During the AWE 
    simulations, we used a 100.8 ps resampling interval to enhance the sampling of (i) the distance 
    between the RBD and ACE2 centers of mass, (ii) the total number of atomic contacts between the 
    RBD and ACE2, and (iii) the complex pRMSD (the square root of the product of the RMSD of the RBD 
    after aligning on ACE2 and the RMSD of ACE2 after aligning on the RBD).
