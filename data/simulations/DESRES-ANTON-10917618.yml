title: DESRES-ANTON-10917618 10 µs simulation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 RNA polymerase complex in aqueous solution
description: >
    A 10 µs simulation trajectory of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 RNA polymerase complex determined in the 
    absence of reducing agent (PDB entry 6M71). In the simulation, the partially disordered N-terminal region 
    (residue 30 to residue 120) of the NiRAN domain folded into a stable ordered structure that resembles the
    N-lobe fold of protein kinases. Lys 73 in β3 forms a salt bridge with Glu 83 in αC for most of the simulation, 
    a common feature of protein kinases. The protein kinase-like fold formed in simulation is in good agreement 
    with the structure of the same complex determined in the presence of reducing agent (PDB entry 7BTF). 
    Structural comparison shows that the protein kinase-like fold in the NiRAN domain shares high similarity 
    with that of the bacterial protein SELO, a protein kinase that catalyzes the transfer of adenosine 5'-monophosphate 
    (AMP) to Ser, Thr and Tyr residues of target proteins, consistent with a potential connection between SELO and 
    SARS-CoV-1 nps12 noted in a previous study. The simulations used the Amber ff99SB-ILDN force field for proteins, 
    the CHARMM TIP3P model for water. The C- and N-peptide termini capped with amide and acetyl groups respectively. 
    The missing loops in the published structural models were manually built as extended peptide conformation. 
    The missing part of Chain D was built through homology modeling using the structure of SARS-CoV-1 polymerase 
    complex (PDB entry 6NUR). The system was neutralized and salted with NaCl, with a final concentration of 0.15 M. 
    The interval between frames is 1.2 ns. The simulations were conducted in the NPT ensemble. The structural 
    similarity search was done using the DALI server, and the SELO structure (PDB entry 6EAC) was the highest ranked 
    protein in the list.
